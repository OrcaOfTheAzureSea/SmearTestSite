        <h1>What is a smear test?</h1>
        <div class="page-text">A smear test, which is also known as a cervical screening test, is a screening that checks for cervical cancer by collecting cells from the cervix. This detects any abnormal changes and helps decide if these changes should need treated. 
            The NHS offers regular cervical screening for woman aged 25 to 64 who are registered with a GP, who have a cervix and have ever been sexually active. Its an important step in taking care of your health!
            A smear test also includes testing for HPV (human papillomavirus). HPV is a common virus that can lead to  cervical cancer. By detecting the presence of HPV, smear tests can help identify woman who may be at higher risk of developing cervical cancer

            <div class="float-child">
                <div class="page-text">During your smear test,you will be asked to lie down on the examination bed. A healthcare professional will then gently insert a speculum into the vagina to get a clear view of the cervix 
                    They will then use a small brush or spatula to collect a sample of cells from the cervix. 
                    This sample is then sent to a lab for analysis. 
                     If have questions or worries about the test, let the nurse or doctor know. They will understand and try to make you comfortable.

        <h1>Receiving your results</h1>
        <div class="page-text">You’ll receive the results of your smear test via letter. When you’re at your cervical screening appointment, your nurse or doctor can tell you how long this is likely to take. Try not to worry about your results, even if they are later than you expect. Most people have a normal result.
            The letter will explain what they tested and what they mean.
            If the HPV virus is not found in your sample, your risk of cervical cancer is very low.
            If the HPV virus is found, you’ll be told what you need to do next. This could involve a repeat test in a year or another screening test called a colposcopy. This is like a smear test but is carried out at a hospital.
